								<h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
								<h4>Company: <span class="blur">Company 1</span></h4>
								<h4>Duration: <span class="blur">Mnt 20XX to Mnt 20XX</span> (~5Â½ years)</h4>
								<p>I started there as a junior, but by staying there for quite some time I was able to
									grow with the company, learn a lot until I started working as a Technical Reference
									while being a Senior Developer.
									I was able to work on several projects, some of my main achievements while there
									were:
								<ul>
									<li>Improved the process to integrate new clients APIs by 75%, reducing the
										required development time from 8hrs-16hrs to 2hrs-4 hrs
									</li>
									<li>Also led the integration of a partner's API with our service, and developed a
										pay-per-use bus directions system that reduced clients costs with bus tickets by
										more than 20%.
									</li>
								</ul>
								As a technical leader, I kept my developer duties, but also helped with new developers
								training, code reviews and led some training sessions such as:
								<ul>
									<li>Code Quality, Clean Code and Git good practices</li>
									<li>Basic and most common deisgn patterns</li>
									<li>Unit and integration tests</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Tech Lead</h3>
								<h4>Company: <span class="blur">Company 2</span></h4>
								<h4>Duration: <span class="blur">Mnt 20XX to Mnt 20XX</span> (~1 years)</h4>
								A few of my main duties ad achievements were:
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Code Reviews</li>
									<li>Deployng code to productions and automate it's process</li>
									<li>Integrate with partners API, improving the process to collect data.</li>
									<li>Migrated data-access layer previously using MS SQL procedures to use Entity
										Framework ORM, with Unit of Work and Repository patterns reducing the
										development cost, code reusability, and testability.</li>
									<li>Led the development of projects that impacted teachers and students creating a
										fully integrated platform that generated automatic analytics to improve teaching
										material.</li>

								<h3>Support Engineer</h3>
								<h4>Company: <span class="blur">Company 3</span></h4>
								<h4>Duration: <span class="blur">Mnt 20XX to Mnt 20XX</span> (~1 year)</h4>
								<p>This experience was unique to me since I had close contact with clients and was able
									to see theirs need being met and get feedback on first hand.<br />
									During this time I:
								<ul>
									<li>Studied clients and managers issues to create technical tasks to improve the
										system user experience and later get the feedback about the solution</li>
									<li>Created tools that integrated with several platforms to automate support tasks
										which greatly reduced the need for human interaction to notify and execute
										tasks.</li>
									<li>Developed new features, improved reporting, and created automatic asynchronous
										notifications services.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
								<h4>Company: <span class="blur">Company 4</span></h4>
								<h4>Duration: <span class="blur">Mnt 20XX</span> to Current (~6 months)</h4>
								<p>
									Just started this position recently, so there's no much to say yet.<br />
									I still work as FullStack, but this time with some new techstack, and working in
									different small projects each cyclie. A great experience so far, but maybe I'll have
									more to say about it ina few more months.

								<h4>Expeditor: Scrum Alliance</h4>
								<h4>Date: 2018</h4>
								<p>While I was in my Job 1 I had they unique experience to work as Scrum Master for a
									few projects.<br />

									14hrs long course about scrum and taking the certification test by the end of it.

								<h4>Expeditor: Microsoft</h4>
								<h4>Date: 2019</h4>
								<p>I must say, study for this certification and practice everything was really fun. CSS
